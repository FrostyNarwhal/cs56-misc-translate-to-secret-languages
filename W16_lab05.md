Findings:

The combined translator has options to change font style and color, but the individual translators do not. The combined translator and PigLatin translators have help/instructions, but the Gibberish translator does not. Otherwise, the Gibberish translator seems nicer (it has a drop-down menu instead of two buttons, etc.).

The README.md is poorly formatted, hard to mentally parse in some paragraphs.
